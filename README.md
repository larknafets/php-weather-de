# php-weather-de
Shows actual weather data from your Netatmo weather station combined with Wetter.com forecast and DWD information as well as BSH tides data.

## Audience
The software uses data from Wetter.com and Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) as well as optional tides data from Bundesamt f√ºr Seeschifffahrt und Hdydrographie (BSH); therefore it is for Netatmo weather stations located in Germany to add additional information to the current Netatmo data of your station.
